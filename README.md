## Overview

We’ve all taken that first Git tutorial. The one where you’re led to
believe that you just need to know about commit, push, & pull, and you
will have Git mastered. But little by little, the doubts start to creep
in. What’s the difference between a merge and a rebase? What does
“fast-forwarding” mean and should you do it? And that’s even before you
get started with the confusing world of reset vs revert!

This tutorial is aimed at those data scientists who want to take the
next step on their path to Git mastery. We’ll assume that all
participants have used Git & GitHub/ GitLab in the past, and now need
some guidance on what they look at next.

The course will be fully interactive. Each section will start with a few
slides setting the scene, before moving onto interactive exercises. The
course will revolve around three core resources, a course GitHub
repository, a course R package, and the participants own repository.

After installing the course package, participants will be able to create
multiple, local git repositories, with different histories. This will
enable participants to quickly create multiple git histories which will
allow them to easily explore different scenarios and methods.

During the course, participants will be formed into small groups and
asked to create git repositories to practice their newfound skills.

### Pre-requisites

All participants should be familiar with basic Git and GitHub. In
particular, they should be comfortable with

-   committing
-   pushing
-   cloning

For example, the first course exercise will be

-   Fork this repo to your own account
-   Clone the repo to your own machine
-   Update the README file
-   Push the changes to your repo

Basic R is also required. During the course, we will use a very basic R
package as a running example.

Attendees are expected to use the provided training environment, and
therefore there is no pre-work.

If you wish to use your own set up, please ensure that you have a
working version of git.

## Learning Objectives

The main objectives of this tutorial are to enable people to confidently
use the more advanced features of Git in their daily workflows. The
topics covered are

-   Rebasing, merging and rewinding
-   Squashing commits
-   Resetting and reverting
-   Setting up your GitHub repository

## Is this course for me?

This course will be appropriate for you if you answer yes to these
questions:

1.  Have you created a simple R package before?
2.  Are you comfortable with basic git commands?
3.  Would you like to learn about more advanced Git commands and where
    they can be used?
